# DV_Ops 
## Computer Science Divisons largest committé
DV_Ops is the IT Committee of
DVD. We are responsible for all
IT-related matters in Monaden,
including maintaining our wonderful website.

DV_Ops also exists to promote
IT interest for everyone and
foster open-source software
and the hacker spirit within the
program.

Throughout the year, we plan
game jams, hackathons, and
maybe even a LAN party in Monaden.

Everyone is always welcome,
regardless of your level of expertise. As long as you have an interest, that’s what matters! You
can recognize us by our constant
preaching about why you should
install Linux on your laptop..
