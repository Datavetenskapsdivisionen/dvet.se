# About us
The Computer Science Division is a non-profit association under Göta Studentkår.
The association primarily represents the programs Computer Science (Bachelor), Computer Science (Master), and Applied Data Science at the University of Gothenburg.

The association consists of a board and several committees.
The board runs the association and makes sure everyone has a good time, while committees hold fun events, 
make sure our courses maintain their quality and more!

The association mostly resides in [The Monad](https://goo.gl/maps/vp7kAQRcWrZWo2Xc9),
which is our section premises at Johanneberg, in the Edit house at Chalmers.
