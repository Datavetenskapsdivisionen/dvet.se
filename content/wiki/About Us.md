# About us
The Computer Science Division is a non-profit organization under Göta Studentkår.
The organization primarily represents the programs Computer Science (Bachelor), Computer Science (Master), and Applied Data Science at the University of Gothenburg.

The organization consists of a board and several committees.
The board runs the organization and makes sure everyone has a good time, while committees hold fun events, 
make sure our courses maintain their quality and more!

The organization mostly resides in [The Monad](https://goo.gl/maps/vp7kAQRcWrZWo2Xc9),
which is our section premises at Johanneberg, in the Edit house at Chalmers.

To join the organization, you first need to join [Göta Studentkår](https://gotastudentkar.se/sv/medlemsformaner)

Unfortunately (i.e. laziness) the rest of this Wiki will be in Swedish, so if you need any information
from here that is in english, feel free to email us at [styrelsen@dvet.se](mailto:styrelsen@dvet.se) and 
we will try to help you as best we can!
