# Style Guide
When representing the organization, it is important to use the correct logos and styles. 
This document describes which logos can be used and how official documents should be adapted.

## Organization's Logos
Using a logo is important for recognition, and the organization's logos fall into two categories:
### External Use
These logos should be used when representing the organization externally, whether it is towards a company,
the University of Gothenburg, Chalmers, or similar organizations. 
You as a user are free to apply any color to these logos.

    <div class="wiki-image-holder">
        <img src="./External%20Logo%20with%20Text.svg">
        <a href="./External%20Logo%20with%20Text.svg" download>External logo with text ↓</a>
    </div>
    <div class="wiki-image-holder">
        <img src="./External%20Logo.svg">
        <a href="./External%20Logo.svg" download>External logo ↓</a>
    </div>
</div>

    </div>
</div>

## Documents
Official organization documents, such as board meeting minutes and general meeting minutes, should be written in LaTeX. [A template can be found 
here](https://github.com/Datavetenskapsdivisionen/dokument/tree/trunk/templates/latex). 

For other documents, such as business plans to be sent to the student union, it is acceptable to use a service like Google Documents with [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WicM_XWqLPlpme1JKDc7d0DFsVsEui78ci9sD53Z3Ro/edit#heading=h.5fyyp94ui1cs). The easiest way is to make a copy of the document when it is to be used.

Committee documents are not bound to these templates as their documents are primarily shared internally. However, for documents directed to external individuals, it is recommended to use these templates as a base.

## Presentations 
Although there are no strict guidelines for how presentations should be adapted, it is recommended to use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YJ3ERnv-nscoHu6VvuULP1GbAhcUQaTDjhtcxa1DhSg/edit?usp=sharing).
The easiest way is to make a copy of the template when it is to be used.

Committees are also recommended to use this template when giving presentations or participating in meetings with participants outside the organization.

## Göta Student Union
Since the Computer Science Division is an organization under the Göta Student Union, it may be necessary to use
Göta Student Union's visual identity.
[Their guidelines can be found here](https://gota-studentkar.gitbook.io/goeta-wik/kommunikation/visuell-identitet).
