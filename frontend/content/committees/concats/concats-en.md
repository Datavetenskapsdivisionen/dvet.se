# ConCats 
ConCats is a growing committee
with 6 awesome members. Our
task is to work towards creating
a pleasant environment in the
Monad where everyone feels
welcome and included, as well as
organizing various events.

We host game nights, movie
nights, or barbecues when the
weather allows. Additionally, we
take care of the Monad premises and ensure that it remains
enjoyable there.

Hopefully, you will figure out
why we are called ConCats if you
have any experience in Haskell.

Do you like free snacks, food,
movies, and games? Then you
would fit right into ConCats.
Those who are interested can
become members during the
orientation period, which will be
held shortly after your first few
weeks.
