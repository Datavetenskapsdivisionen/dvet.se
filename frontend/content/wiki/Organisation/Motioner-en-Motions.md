# Motions
During the association's meetings (annual meetings), you as a student have the chance to submit motions for changes you want to see at the association level. 
It could be that you want to start a new committee, become the chairperson of a committee, or request that the board plants new grass outside Monaden. 
It can be anything that you find important as a student and member of our association.

Writing a motion is very simple and you need to follow the following template:
```md
# <Title>
<Body text>

<Signature>

Proposals:
    * To <do this>
    * ...
```
After you have filled in your motion, it should be emailed to [styrelsen@dvet.se](mailto:styrelsen@dvet.se), 
and the board will bring it up at the next meeting.

An example of a motion could be the following:
```md
# Monaden Rat
I like rats, and I find that a 
rat would really improve the study environment in Monaden, 
as I would finally have someone who is on the same 
wavelength as myself.

- Tim "BÃ¥tsman" Persson

Proposals:
    * That the board should investigate the possibility of acquiring a rat 
      for Monaden by the next meeting.
```

If you want more examples of motions, the easiest way is to look at previous motions, which can be found here [drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h7-Z6NVr7QQX3yG1gPSWCd99sdP6x7Dq](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h7-Z6NVr7QQX3yG1gPSWCd99sdP6x7Dq).
