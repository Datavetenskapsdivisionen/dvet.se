# About Us
The Computer Science Division is a non-profit organization under Göta Studentkår.
The organization primarily represents the programs Computer Science (Bachelor), Computer Science (Master), and Applied Data Science at the University of Gothenburg.

The organization consists of a board and several committees.
The board runs the organization and makes sure everyone has a good time, while committees hold fun events, 
ensure our courses maintain their quality, and more!

The organization mostly resides in [Monaden](https://goo.gl/maps/vp7kAQRcWrZWo2Xc9),

To join the organization, you first need to join [Göta Student Union](https://gotastudentkar.se/en/medlemsformaner),
