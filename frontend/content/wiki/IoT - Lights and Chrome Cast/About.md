## Internet of Things in the Monad
There are about 13 IKEA TRADFRI color bulbs, one TRADFRI remote controller, and a Chromecast. Besides this, there also is a local hosted web application. The remote and web application can be used to control the lights and Chromecast. The code which runs the code for this can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/Datavetenskapsdivisionen/monaden-iot).
