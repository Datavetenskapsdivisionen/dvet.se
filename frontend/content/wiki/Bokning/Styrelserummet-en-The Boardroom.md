# The Boardroom

Booking of the boardroom in the NC building is only allowed by active members of the Computer Science Division, that is, committee members, committee chairpersons, and the board.

The boardroom should primarily be used for association matters, but can be used for other purposes as long as no one else needs the room for association matters. If you have made a booking for, for example, studying or personal meetings, you may be asked to leave the room if someone else books it for association matters.

Booking is done [here](https://forms.gle/BEUPUYa2f8rtpq7t8). Note that you can only fill out the form with your `@dvet` email address. Check availability before booking in the channel `#styrelserumpaxx` in `DVD: Aktiva`.

The cleaning schedule posted on the door must be followed.
