# Booking of Monaden

Members of the Computer Science Division can book Monaden. Bookings are only allowed after 17:00. If a booking is made less than 24 hours in advance, other members have the right to deny it. In case of a conflict, bookings are on a first-come, first-served basis.

Monaden can only be booked for the general benefit of students. It cannot be booked for group work, private parties, or movie nights for a small group of friends. However, it can be booked for events such as sittings, study sessions, or movie nights open to everyone.

A rule of thumb is that all members of the Computer Science Division should have the opportunity to participate in the event.

Bookings are made using the form below. The board reserves the right to reject bookings.

After the event, the person who booked Monaden is responsible for cleaning.

**NOTE**: During the Introduction period, DVRK manages Monaden's bookings, and all bookings must be approved by them.

## Other associations

As a rule of thumb, we only allow lending for events where students belonging to the Computer Science Division are welcome.
